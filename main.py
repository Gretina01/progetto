"""This program allows you to obtain information on the availability of parking in Bologna.
The car parks considered are VIII Agosto, Riva Reno, Autostazione.
First you need to store the dataset, it can be imported both locally and online.
To work on the data you need to convert the dataset, which is initially a dictionary, 
into a list of objects compliant with the Parking object.
To define the Parking lot object, create a class that models a parking lot considering the name, 
total spaces and coordinates. It inherits the coordinates from a class that allows you to model 
a point as a function of latitude and longitude.
For each Parking object created, the findings present in the dataset are added to it.
Once this is done, it is possible to obtain graphs based on the time slot and the average 
number of free places in %, letting the user choose the month and day of the week.
It is possible to save graphs as an image file, with the possibility of choosing the format, 
and as a csv file, with the possibility of choosing the name of the columns and the delimiter.
Furthermore, it is possible to have the user enter their position, in terms of latitude and 
longitude, the month and the time in which they would like to go to a car park in Bologna.
The program is able to define which car park has statically more availability and calculate 
the distance of the car park from the position entered by the user.
All functions used have been validated and tested, and handled with exceptions.
Furthermore, the program is divided into modules to make the entire code more understandable."""
